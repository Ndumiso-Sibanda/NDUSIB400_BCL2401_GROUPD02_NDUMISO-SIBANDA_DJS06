JavaScript Array Methods Project
This project is designed to deepen the understanding of JavaScript's array methods by manipulating data using forEach, map, filter, reduce, and more.

Data Sets
provinces: List of provinces
names: List of names
products: List of products with prices
Exercises
forEach Basics: Log names, provinces, and name-province pairs.
Uppercase Transformation: Create an array of uppercase province names.
Name Lengths: Create an array containing the length of each name.
Sorting: Alphabetically sort the provinces.
Filtering Cape: Remove provinces containing "Cape".
Finding 'S': Create a boolean array if a name contains 'S'.
Creating Object Mapping: Transform names array into an object mapping names to provinces.
Advanced Exercises
Log Products: Iterate over products array, logging each product name.
Filter by Name Length: Filter out products with names longer than 5 characters.
Price Manipulation: Filter out products without prices, convert string prices to numbers, and calculate total price.
Concatenate Product Names: Concatenate all product names into a single string.
Find Extremes in Prices: Identify highest and lowest-priced items.
Object Transformation: Recreate products object with keys 'name' and 'cost'.
What I Learned
Deeper understanding of JavaScript array methods.
Application of functional programming concepts.
Importance of combining multiple array methods.
Improvements
Use arrow functions consistently for a cleaner syntax.
Add error handling for cases where data is missing or invalid.
Improve variable naming for better readability.
Conclusion
This project challenged me to think more declaratively and utilize JavaScript's array methods effectively. By combining these methods, I was able to manipulate data in various ways, leading to more concise and readable code. This exercise has deepened my understanding of functional programming concepts and how to apply them in real-world scenarios.
